            CAPS (Climate Adaptation Plan Society) aims to incorporate
            disability inclusion into all its climate-smart activities and
            community benefits. As per CAPSâ€™s regulations, disability inclusion
            will be in a ratio of 10:1, meaning one person with disabilities
            will be involved for every ten capable people. Climate-smart
            adaptation for disabled people involves integrating their specific
            needs and vulnerabilities into climate change resilience strategies.

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            This approach includes ensuring accessible infrastructure,
            developing inclusive early warning systems, and promoting livelihood
            diversification. It also requires actively involving disabled people
            in the planning and implementation of adaptation measures, ensuring
            their voices are heard and their rights are protected.
